        # This command specifically tries to install the problematic package directly.
        # Sometimes npm has trouble with it as an "optional" dependency during ci/install.
        # We target the version that Rollup expects.
        # You might need to check your rollup version in package-lock.json to be precise.
        # For general rollup issues, this often works.
        run: npm install @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu --save-optional
        # Alternatively, if --save-optional doesn't work or causes issues, try:
        # run: npm install @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu
        # And then run npm install again to fix potential peer dependency issues:
        # run: npm install
